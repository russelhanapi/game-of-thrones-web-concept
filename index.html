              Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series
              created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. The show was
              shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta,
              Morocco, and Spain. It premiered on HBO in the United States on
              April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes
              broadcast over eight seasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the A Song
              of Ice and Fire book series by George R. R. Martin, set in the
              fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos.
              The series follows several simultaneous plot lines. The first
              story arc follows a war of succession among competing claimants
              for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other
              noble families fighting for independence from the throne. The
              second concerns the exiled scion's actions to reclaim the throne;
              the third chronicles the threat of the impending winter, as well
              as the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North.

                The imaginary continent of Westeros was once inhabited by a
                magical people, the Children of the Forest. For centuries, other
                people came across the Narrow Sea from the eastern continent of
                Essos: up North, the First Men; in the Center, the Andals; down
                South, the Dornish. With time, the Children of the Forest were
                relegated to the world of legends, and the different ethnicities
                divided the continent into seven major kingdoms. Now, in this
                South of Essos, there was an ancient and powerful civilization
                called Valyria that ruled through magic and dragons. The
                Valyrians also came to Westeros and established three clans: the
                Velaryon, the Celtigar, and the powerful dragon-riders, the
                Targaryens. One such Targaryen, Aegon the Conqueror, united the
                Seven Kingdoms of Westeros under his rule, and the Targaryens
                controlled Westeros for centuries, even after their homeland of
                Valyria was destroyed in a mysterious holocaust.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Targaryen rule was an unstable balance between their pagan
                Valyrian rituals, which were based on incest to keep their blood
                line pure because it was their Valyrian blood that allowed them
                control of the dragons, and Westeros' various religions and
                uses, including the Andal religion of the Seven Gods. Many wars
                were fought until King Jaeherys established peace and balance in
                Westeros. Unfortunately, a war among the Targaryen family,
                called "The Dance of the Dragons," destroyed most of the
                Targaryens and their dragons. For generations, the Targaryen
                power dwindled until their last king, Aerys III, the "Mad King,"
                was haunted by delusions and hallucinations and abused his
                power, insulting many of the Seven Kingdoms' major families. War
                ensued. After kidnapping a young lady from the Stark clan
                (rulers of the North and descendants of the First Men) and
                murdering her father and brother who sought justice, her younger
                brother Ned Stark allied with her betrothed Robert Baratheon,
                Lord of Storm's End, and an Andal, and the Targaryens were
                deposed of the throne and killed, in battle or massacre, except
                for two young babies who were promptly evacuated to Essos.

                Several years later, this show begins. A three-man team surveils
                the frozen north to find an ancient menace returning, but the
                remaining survivor, a simple fool, is thought to be crazy and is
                beheaded for desertion by a much older Ned Stark. At the same
                time, his village is visited by the king, Robert Baratheon, now
                an old and fat man, married to a lady from the Lannister clan
                (and former allies of the Targaryens before they betrayed them
                when they realized Baratheon was winning the war). The
                right-hand man of the King, aptly named "Hand of the King," died
                in mysterious circumstances, and Robert names Ned Stark his
                successor to find out what happened. During his stay in the
                capital, King's Landing, Ned Stark finds that the former Hand of
                the King discovered a major conspiracy by the queen, Cersei
                Lannister, and that her sons and heirs to the throne were
                bastards. But the King dies in a "hunting accident," and the
                Queen gives the throne to her son. Trying to denounce the coup,
                Ned Stark is arrested and beheaded by his own sword. His men are
                all killed, and only her two daughters survive—the naive Sansa,
                betrothed to the new king, and Arya, who managed to escape. His
                elder son, Robb Stark, is named King in the North and rides down
                on King's Landing to avenge his father.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other contestants claim the crown too, starting a war that
                ravages the Seven Kingdoms and takes up most of the first three
                seasons. Robb Stark is killed by treason, and the Lannisters
                consider the war won. But then the young king Joffrey is
                poisoned, and all blame falls on the uncle, a very smart dwarf
                that the queen hates because she blames him for killing their
                mother during labor. The dwarf, Tyrion Lannister, escapes, but
                his adventures make up part of most of the remaining seasons.
                Queen Cersei replaces Joffrey with another son, but then King's
                Landing is taken over by a powerful religious movement that
                denounces her as incestuous and shames her in front of everybody
                in King's Landing. Cersei eventually kills everyone in
                vengeance, including the betrothed new queen. And his last son
                commits suicide as a result of his grief. Cersei is now the sole
                ruler of Westeros. Or should be, because the two Targaryenm
                babies, now young adults, have been plotting to reclaim their
                throne in Essos since the first episode.

                Viserys, a madly ambitious young man, ends up being killed, but
                his sister, Daennerys, marries a powerful warlord and receives
                three dragon eggs as a wedding gift. Thought to be barren eggs
                that have turned into stone, Daennerys manages to hatch them,
                and her adventures begin at the end of the first season.
                Expelled from the tribe after her husband's death, she crosses
                the desert, facing all sorts of dangers and enemies, until she
                manages to reach a slave city, where she sells her dragons to
                buy an army of thousands of slaves, then turns her dragons on
                the slave-owners. Thus begins her story as "Breaker of Chains."
                After invading and destroying all slaver cities and freeing
                millions of people, she manages to reconquer her old tribe and
                crosses the Narrow Sea to invade Westeros.

              <p>
                However, up North... Jon Snow, Ned Stark's bastard, joins the
                Night's Watch, a militia of "forced volunteers" who guard a
                large, magical wall of ice that separates the Lands of Always
                Winter, up north, and the rest of Westeros. He discovers the
                ancient peril the simple fool warned about in the first episode
                is all too real. He rises to commander of the Night's Watch and
                unites his men with the lost tribes of Wildlings, free men that
                roam the northern lands above the Wall, free of the laws of the
                Seven Kingdoms. He saves them all from an attack by "wights,"
                zombie-like dead people reanimated by the mysterious White
                Walkers, people who appear to be made of ice and are led by the
                Night King. But the Night's Watch does not like his decisions,
                so they kill him. And here the books end their story. But the
                show goes on. Using magic, a mysterious sorcerer called
                Melisandre, who worships the Lord of Light and fights the Night
                King, reanimates Jon Snow. Thus begins the story of Jon Snow,
                future king of the North.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the remaining episodes, Jon Snow manages to take back the
                castle of Winterfell, which belonged to the Starks, and reunites
                with a much less naive Sansa Stark, who becomes an intelligent
                ruler, and a cruel Arya Stark, who becomes an assassin. They
                also reunite with the much younger Bran Stark, who had acquired
                magical powers that allowed him to see the past. Together, they
                manage to ally with Daenerys Targaryen in their fight against
                the Lannisters, but also against the army of the dead, led by
                the Night King. His army attacks Winterfell to kill Bran Stark,
                for he's the only one with powers to stop the Night King.
              </p>
              <p>
                The battle is overwhelming—and the Night King has one of
                Daenerys's dragons, which he killed and reanimated as an ice
                dragon! In the last minute, when the Night King is about to kill
                a defenseless Bran Stark, Arya shows her prowess as an assassin
                and stabs the Night King with a very famous Valyrian blade.
              </p>
              <p>
                After defeating the Night King, the combined armies of Jon
                Snow's Northernmen and Daenerys's savage riders attack King's
                Landing and defeat the Lannisters. But Daenerys shows she's
                really the "Mad King's" daughter by destroying King's Landing
                even after the surrender of the city, and she vows on the total
                submission of the entire Seven Kingdoms like her ancestors
                did—thereby endangering the freedom of the Northern men. Jon
                Snow, who grew up to be her lover, makes a final sacrifice by
                killing her to ensure lasting peace in Westeros.
